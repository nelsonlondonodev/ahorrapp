## Documentation of Work Done (Ahorrapp Project - Supabase Integration)

**Objective:** Integrate a real Supabase backend to replace the `localStorage` mock for managing financial transactions in the Ahorrapp React application.

**Steps Completed:**

1.  **Project Analysis:**
    *   Reviewed `README.md`, `package.json`, `index.html`, `src/main.jsx`, and `src/App.jsx` to understand the project structure, dependencies, and existing mock backend implementation.
    *   Identified the `supabase` mock object in `src/App.jsx` as the primary target for replacement.

2.  **`README.md` Update:**
    *   Moved the content from `documentation.txt` (containing project improvement suggestions) into `README.md`.
    *   Cleared the content of `documentation.txt`.

3.  **Supabase Client Installation:**
    *   Installed the `@supabase/supabase-js` npm package.

4.  **Supabase Client Configuration:**
    *   Created `src/supabaseClient.js` to initialize the Supabase client.

5.  **`App.jsx` Modifications (Supabase Integration):**
    *   Removed the mock `supabase` object and related `localStorage` functions from `src/App.jsx`.
    *   Added the import for the real `supabase` client in `src/App.jsx`.
    *   Updated CRUD operations (`fetchTransactions`, `handleAddTransaction`, `handleUpdateTransaction`, `handleDeleteTransaction`) in `src/App.jsx` to use the real Supabase client, including `.select()` for inserts/updates and `.eq('id', ...)` for updates/deletes, and improved date sorting.

6.  **Supabase Project Setup (User-Guided):**
    *   Provided step-by-step instructions for creating a Supabase project.
    *   Provided step-by-step instructions for creating the `transactions` table with the necessary columns and setting `user_id`'s default value to `auth.uid()`.
    *   Provided step-by-step instructions for configuring Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the `transactions` table (Read, Insert, Update, Delete).
    *   Confirmed that all four RLS policies were correctly set up by the user.

7.  **Environment Variables Setup (User-Guided):**
    *   Instructed the user to create a `.env` file in the project root.
    *   Instructed the user to add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to the `.env` file with their actual Supabase credentials.
    *   Reminded the user to add `.env` to `.gitignore`.

**Current Status and Next Steps:**

The application code has been updated to interact with a real Supabase backend, and the Supabase project (table and RLS policies) has been configured.

**The current issue is a `401 (Unauthorized)` error indicating an RLS policy violation during an `INSERT` operation.** This is because the application currently lacks a user authentication flow. The RLS policies are correctly set up to only allow operations by an authenticated user on their own data (via `auth.uid()`), but there is no mechanism in the application to authenticate a user.

**To continue in the next chat, we will focus on implementing a basic user authentication flow in the Ahorrapp application.** This will involve:

1.  **Adding Supabase Authentication:** Using `supabase.auth` methods to allow users to sign up and sign in.
2.  **Managing User Sessions:** Storing and retrieving user session information.
3.  **Updating `App.jsx`:** Modifying the application to ensure that CRUD operations are performed by an authenticated user.
